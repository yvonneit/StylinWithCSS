    <p>Scripted with ostentatious erudition by James Ivory, no less, and based on a 2007 novel by André Aciman—who plays an eccentric bit part—Call Me By Your Name is a gay male love story, but there’s something entirely universal about its story of unalloyed mutual desire between two people. The setting is a villa somewhere amid the rural splendour of Northern Italy, and the year is 1983. Elio spends holidays there with his parents, each summer bringing a visit from a different student, there to work with Elio’s father</p>
